### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'll be on the job market soon so if you know of interesting opportunities and/or teams, let's chat!

I'm Kristian, a final-year Ph.D. student at University of Oxford, currently working on reinforcement learning and robotics. I like open-source and reusable software and research.

Here's a summary of what I've been doing in the past:
- Research Intern at [Google Brain Robotics](https://research.google/teams/robotics/).
- Research Scientist intern at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) robotics.
- Research Engineer intern at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) robotics.
- Research Staff at [Robotics and AI Lab](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/) at University of California, Berkeley.
- Software Engineer at [Statwing](https://www.statwing.com/) and [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/).
